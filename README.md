# Timus Online Judge solutions

This repo contains my solutions to [Timus](http://acm.timus.ru/).

Most of them were written during my first two years (2010-2012) of studying in [USU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_State_University).

The code is dirty in most cases because there were no point to wrote readable code, only fast solutions.

Each folder in solutions is a problem id, for example folder solutions/1000 contains all my accepted solutions to [A+B](http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1000) problem.
